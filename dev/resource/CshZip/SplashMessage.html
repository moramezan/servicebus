<h1>
    Introducing Messages
</h1>

<p>
    Messages represent real-world events. These occur all the time, for example, a clock strikes
    midnight, or a bank account becomes overdrawn.
</p>

<p>
    A message wraps attributes supporting an event in a common structure.
</p>

<p>
    A process will perform work upon receipt of a message.
</p>

<p>
    All messages enter a queue, which can be seen from the Messages tab.

<p>
    <strong>Pause Queue</strong> halts the processing of new Messages. New Messages will be queued
    up outside their destined Sequence. Old Messages already in a Sequence will filter through to
    completion.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Resume Queue</strong> resumes the processing of all Messages.

<p>
    <strong>Process Message</strong> forces this Message to be processed immediately. You can use
    this button to process individual Messages when the system is paused, or to reprocess any
    Message that could not be processed.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Show Data</strong> takes you to the native view of the underlying data pointed at by the
    Message. This button can be used to edit or audit the data of any specific Message handed into a
    given Process.
