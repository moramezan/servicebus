<h1>
    Gate By Entry Point process
</h1>

<p>
<ul>
    <li>A related collection of messages may proceed down the same sequence
        in separate execution contexts.
        <br/>For most requirements, this is acceptable and desired behaviour but
        a need may  arise for a downstream process <em>to act on these related messages in a single
            transaction context</em>.
    </li>
    <li>An <code>GateByEntryPoint</code> process enables the above scenario by utilising
        the <code>Entry Point Uuid</code> field as a grouping key on all messages
        that have previously passed through the same prior processes .
