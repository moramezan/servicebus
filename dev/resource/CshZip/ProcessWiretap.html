    <legend>Note</legend>
    Wiretap is a 'pass-through' process which does not alter the event parameters or have any
    other side effects. It is primarily a learning and debugging tool.

    specific user can be nominated to receive these emails.

        Click on the <em>Wiretap</em> process, then click <strong>View Settings</strong>.
        This will take you to the <em>Wiretap Custom Settings</em> view.
    </li>
    <li>
        Here you can create an organization-wide setting called User Id that specifies the user to
        whom Wiretap emails will be sent. Enter the <code>Id</code> of the user you nominate.
