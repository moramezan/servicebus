<h3>
    Messages and Events
</h3>

<p>
    Events occur all the time. (For example: the clock strikes twelve, the fuel tank reaches empty).
    To represent details about an event in a computer system, we use a special object called a
    message. The primary purpose of a message is to provide a useful mechanism to communicate to a
    processes that a particular event has occurred.
</p>

<h3>
    Event Based Architecture
</h3>

<p>
    Specific events are only relevant to specific processes. For this reason a <em>Broker</em>
    routes event messages (representing specific events) to specific processes within the system.
</p>

<p>
    Combinations of specific event messages to specific processes can be reduced to a routing table
    called a <code>Sequence</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Breaking up work into specific processes that respond to specific event messages is known as
    Event Driven Architecture. The Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) is a specific implementation of
    Event Driven Architecture.
</p>

<h3>
    Command Response Architecture
</h3>

<p>
    Most implementations on Salesforce make use of an alternative to EDA called Command-Response
    Architecture. Under this model, work is centrally directed from a command such as a button
    click or a trigger action.
</p>

<p>
    Complexity grows in an geometric manner as possible execution paths and exception handling paths
    are added to the logic directly attached to the command.
</p>

<h3>
    ESB Processes
</h3>

<p>
    As previously mentioned, events in an ESB framework are represented as messages. A message
    received by a process that has previously registered it's interest in that message type will
    cause the logic of that process to fire.
</p>

<h3>
    Processing Sequence
</h3>

<p>
    An ESB framework facilitates useful work on the Salesforce platform via processes that have
    previously registered their interest the occurrence of a specific event types. (In practise this
    means that a process registers it's interest in events emitted from the process that immediately
    precedes it.)
</p>

<p>
    A register of interest containing sufficient number of processes will naturally resemble a
    sequence of chained processing steps. This register is called a <em>Sequence</em> and the
    sequential processing steps within it are called (sequence) <em>Steps</em>.
</p>

<h3>
    Summary
</h3>

<p>
    The ESB framework is implemented using Event Driven Architecture. The ESB framework logically
    maps processing steps to an underlying business requirement.
</p>

<p>
    Emphasis is placed on narrowly defined, composable units of work. Each unit of work responds to
    the occurrence of a specific event type.
</p>

<p>
    The ESB framework provides a clean model that limits complexity in the system to just the
    testable apex implementation details of any given process. In contrast, the Command-Response
    paradigm attempts to attach all possible logical code paths and associated exception handling to
    a single specific command. This creates code complexity that is not easily tested or modified.
