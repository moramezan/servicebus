<h1>
    Introducing Sequences
</h1>

<p>
    A Sequence is an arrangement of multiple processing tasks called Steps. Each Sequence is known
    by a friendly name, for example 'ProcessInvoices', which should in some way indicate the nature
    of the work that it's processing steps will perform.
</p>

<p>
    The ESB framework will advance Messages through the Steps of a Sequence in the order you specify
    using drag and drop. A typical sequence will contain many steps. See diagram:

    See the following tutorials:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Build a simple <a href="?topic=TutorialSetupConfirmation">WireTap</a> sequence.
    </li>
    <li>
        Build a sequence that groups messages under a
        <a href="?topic=TutorialMessageGrouping">Common Identifier</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>
    When building a new Sequence
</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        Every Step in a Sequence has an associated Process, a numbered Position, and potentially a
        Config.
    </li>
    <li>
        A Terminate process is automatically inserted into a new Sequence at the point that the
        Sequence is created. This Terminate step cannot be deleted.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is the orchestrator's responsibility to ensure the Terminate Process is the final Step in
        every Sequence as any Steps after the Terminate Process will not be executed.
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>New Step</strong> will append a new Sequence step (containing your selected
        process). Once appended, you can drag and drop the step to reposition.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Enqueue Test Message</strong> enqueues a message into the sequence
        (referencing your user record as the underlying data entity <code>esb__Id</code>).
    </li>
</ul>
