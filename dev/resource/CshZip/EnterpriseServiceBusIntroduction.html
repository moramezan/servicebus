<h1>
    Introducing Enterprise Service Bus
</h1>

<p>
    Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) is the only high performance messaging platform native to
    Salesforce. It allows systems to react to real world events. You can model sagas, asynchronous
    processes, and recover from errors without data loss using the drag-and-drop sequence builder.
</p>

<p>
    ESB is predicated on the notion that work is broken up into processes that respond to events.
</p>

<p>
    Using ESB encourages:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>reactive, extensible and event-driven models,</li>
    <li>testable components which have no knowledge of each other,</li>
    <li>developers to be able to code to events via an interface.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Processes</h3>

<p>
    A Process is a single piece of "encapsulated goodness" with inputs and outputs. Logic should be
    separated into distinct processes where:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>the logic of a process is implemented as an Apex Class,</li>
    <li>inputs to a process come in the form of exactly one message,</li>
    <li>outputs of a process consist of zero, one, or many messages,</li>
</ul>

<p>
    After a process receives and acts on a message, its output messages are routed to a subsequent
    process. Processes can split, combine, or alter data, and call Salesforce APIs.
</p>

<h3>Messages</h3>

<p>
    In the real world events occur all the time. For example, the clock strikes 12PM, the fuel tank
    reaches empty, etc. To represent real world events in computer systems, we create a data
    structure called a Message which contains relevant details about the event.
</p>

<p>
    The primary purpose of a message is to provide a useful mechanism to communicate between
    processes. The terms <strong>Message</strong> and <strong>Event</strong> are therefore used
    interchangeably but represent the same concept for the purposes of ths guide. 
</p>

<h3>Sequences</h3>

<p>
    A Sequence is an arrangement of multiple processing tasks called Steps. Each Sequence is known
    by a friendly name, for example 'ProcessInvoices', which should in some way indicate  the nature
    of the work that it's processing steps will perform.
</p>

<p>
    The ESB framework will advance Messages through the Steps of a Sequence in the order you specify
    using drag and drop. A typical sequence will contain many steps. A Sequence is like a
    configurable event-to-process lookup table that routes a given message to the appropriate
    process.
</p>

<!--
<ul>
    <li>Events in the ESB framework are represented as messages</li>
    <li>An event message is handed to specific process. This in turn causes the Apex code contained
        within that process to execute.<br/> (In other words, the occurrence of a given
        <code>event</code> causes a process that has previously registered it's interest in that
        <code>event</code> to perform
    </li>
    <li>This is a clean model that limits complexity in the system to just the apex implementation
        details of any given process</li>
</ul>

<h3>CHAPTER 02 : Concepts : Process and Processing</h3>
<b>Processing :</b><br/>
<ul>
    <li>Work under the ESB framework is broken  into many specific tasks</li>
    <li>Each task is implemented as an Apex class and is made available to the ESB framework as a process</li>
    <li> Every process executes it's task logic in a standard execution method  </li>
    <li>Some processes are native to the ESB framework
        (<code>Gate</code> , <code>WireTap</code>, <code>Publish</code>,  etc)
        while others are implemented as custom plugins (the topic of this guide)
    <li>All ESB processes (native and plugins) adhere to a standard Apex template  </li>
</ul>
