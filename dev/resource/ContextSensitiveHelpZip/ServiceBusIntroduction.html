<h1>
    Introducing Services framework
</h1>

<p>
    Services framework is the only high performance messaging platform native to
    Salesforce. It allows systems to react to real world events. You can model sagas, asynchronous
    services, and recover from errors without data loss using the drag-and-drop sequence builder.
</p>

<p>
    Services framework is predicated on the notion that work is broken up into services that respond to events.
</p>

<p>
    Using the Services framework encourages:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>reactive, extensible and event-driven models,</li>
    <li>testable components which have no knowledge of each other, and</li>
    <li>coding to an interface that responds to events.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Services</h3>

<p>
    A Service is a single piece of "encapsulated goodness" with inputs and outputs. Business logic should be
    divided into distinct services exhibiting the following implementation characteristics:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>a single Apex class per service,</li>
    <li>a single input event injected into each service, and</li>
    <li>the emission of zero, one, or many events as a collection from each service.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    After a service receives and acts on an event, it's output events are routed to a subsequent
    service. Services can split, combine, or alter data, and call Salesforce APIs.
</p>

<h3>Events</h3>

<p>
    In the real world events occur all the time. For example, the clock strikes 12PM, the fuel tank
    reaches empty, etc. To represent real world events in computer systems, we create a data
    structure called an Event which contains relevant details about the real world event.
    The primary purpose of an event is to provide a useful mechanism to communicate between
    services.
</p>


<h3>Messages</h3>

<p>
    Events are persisted in Salesforce via a SObject called a Message.
    The terms <strong>Event</strong> and <strong>Message</strong> are therefore used
    interchangeably but represent the same concept for the purposes of ths guide.
</p>



<h3>Sequences</h3>

<p>
    A Sequence is an arrangement of multiple processing tasks called Steps. Each Sequence is known
    by a friendly name, for example 'ProcessInvoices', which should in some way indicate  the nature
    of the work that it's processing steps will perform.
</p>

<p>
    The Services framework will advance Events through the Steps of a Sequence in the order you specify
    using a drag and drop mechanism. A typical sequence will contain many steps.
</p>


<!-- removed : too technical for the intro
A Sequence is similar to a
    configurable event-to-service lookup table that routes a given message to the appropriate
    service.

-->
<!--
<ul>
    <li>Events in the Service Bus are represented as messages</li>
    <li>An event message is handed to specific service. This in turn causes the Apex code contained
        within that service to execute.<br/> (In other words, the occurrence of a given
        <code>event</code> causes a service that has previously registered it's interest in that
        <code>event</code> to perform
    </li>
    <li>This is a clean model that limits complexity in the system to just the apex implementation
        details of any given service</li>
</ul>

<h3>CHAPTER 02 : Concepts : Service and Processing</h3>
<b>Processing :</b><br/>
<ul>
    <li>Work under the Service Bus is broken  into many specific tasks</li>
    <li>Each task is implemented as an Apex class and is made available to the Service Bus as a service</li>
    <li> Every service executes it's task logic in a standard execution method  </li>
    <li>Some services are native to the Service Bus
        (<code>Gate</code> , <code>WireTap</code>, <code>Publish</code>,  etc)
        while others are implemented as custom services (the topic of this guide)
    <li>All services (native and custom) adhere to a standard Apex template  </li>
</ul>
