    What is a process?
</h3>

<p>
    A process is a single, logical program with inputs and outputs in the form of events. Processes are implemented as Apex classes. Each process handles one event, and may output zero, one, or many new events.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Each process has a Summary that describes it.</li>
    <li>An event is represented in Apex code as <code>Map&lt;String,Object&gt;</code></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>
    How do I write my own process?
</h3>

<pre>
public class SendPayment extends Abstract.Process {
    
    public class Summary {
        String Description = 'Short explanation of the process.';
    }
    
    //http requests go here
    //void callout(Map&lt;String,Object&gt; input) {}
    
    //side effects go here
    //List&lt;Map&lt;String,Object&gt;&gt; execute(Map&lt;String,Object&gt; input) {}
    
}
</pre>

<p>
    Processes are implemented as Apex classes. The Enterprise Service Bus framework ("ESB") contains
    by default a number of ready-made processes, including:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Schedule</li>
    <li>Publish and Subscribe</li>
    <li>Branch, Jump and Subsequence</li>
    <li>Audit and Wiretap</li>
    <li>Mark and Gate</li>
</ul>

    See the tutorial: <a href="?topic=TutorialProcessDiscovery">How to discover ESB Processes</a>.

<h3>
    List View Buttons
</h3>

<p>
    <strong>Discover Processes</strong> can be used to find new Processes. Click this button after
    authoring or installing Processes to make them available.
</p>

<h3>
    Detail Page Buttons
</h3>

<p>
    <strong>View Apex Class</strong> will show you the Apex Class that contains the underlying logic
    for any given Process.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>View Settings</strong> takes you to the available Settings for a Process. (Note: Not all
    process have Settings)
</p>

<p>
    <strong>View Documentation</strong> shows the supporting documentation provided by the author of
    a given Process.
</p>

<h3>
    Discovering Processes
</h3>

<p>
    Before a process written in Apex can be referenced as a step in a sequence, it must first be
    discovered and registered in the Enterprise Service Bus framework.
</p>

<p>
    This discovery job will be launched automatically when installing the package or trying to build
    a sequence for the first time.
</p>

<p>
    There is also a mechanism for discovering processes manually and is initiated by clicking the
    [Discover] button from the Processes list view.
</p>
