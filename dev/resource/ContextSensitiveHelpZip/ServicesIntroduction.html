    Introduction

<p>
    The Services Package is the only high performance messaging platform native to Salesforce.
    It allows systems to react to real world events.
    You can model sagas, complex asynchronous sequences, and recover from errors without data loss.
</p>

<p>
    Service oriented architecture encourages:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>reactive, extensible and event-driven models,</li>
    <li>testable components which have no knowledge of each other, and</li>
    <li>coding to an interface that responds to events.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Services</h2>

<p>
    A Service is a single piece of encapsulated business logic with inputs and outputs.
    Each service is implemented as an Apex class, has a single event as an input,
    and emits zero, one, or many events as outputs.
</p>

<h2>Messages</h2>

<p>
    A message is a container for holding an Event. Wrapping each event in a message gives a handle to identify it.
    The purpose of the message is to perist the communication between services.
    The terms Event and Message can be used interchangeably for most purposes.
</p>



<h2>Sequences</h2>

<p>
    A Sequence is an arrangement of multiple processing tasks called Steps.
    Each Sequence has a name which indicates the kind of work its processing steps will perform.
    The Services Package will advance events through the steps of a sequence in the order you specify
    using the drag and drop builder.
