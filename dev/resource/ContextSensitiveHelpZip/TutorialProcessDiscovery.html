<h1>
    Process Discovery Tutorial
</h1>

<p>
    The objective of this tutorial is to discover new processes so they can be referenced by a step
    in a sequence.

<p>
    Expected duration: 5 minutes.

    Instructions

<p>
    Before a Process can be referenced as a step in a sequence, it must first be discovered and
    registered by the ESB framework. The framework can analyse all Apex logic in the organization to
    discover classes that conform to a process specification. All valid ESB processes are registered and made available for potential selection by the system orchestrator when building sequences under the tab.
