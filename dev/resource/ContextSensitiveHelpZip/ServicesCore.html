    Core Services

<p>
    This section is intended for Services framework Configurators, Business Analysts, Salesforce System
    Administrators, and Force.com Apex Developers. The purpose is to explain the use and
    configuration of each pre-packaged service in the Services framework.

    This section does not cover designing building and deploying custom services. That topic is
    described in the separate <a href="?topic=GuideDevelopers">Service Developer's Guide</a>. This
    section does not cover configuring or monitoring the  Services framework. That topic is
    described in the separate <a href="?topic=GuideOrchestrators">Orchestrator's Guide</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The Services framework has pre-packaged services. These pre-packaged services are classified
    under the tag "Services". Some services work in isolation (for example
    <em>Wiretap</em>) while other services work in tandem (for example <em>Publish</em> and
    <em>Subscribe</em>)

    Some services are no-operation or pass-through in nature. These simply forward all
    received messages to the next step in their respective sequence, without any side effects.
