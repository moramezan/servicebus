<h1>
    Terminate Process
</h1>

<p>
    Every Sequence must have a Terminate Process.
</p>

<p>
    A Terminate process step is automatically inserted when a Sequence is created.
</p>

<p>
    It is the orchestrator's responsibility to ensure the termination process is the final step in the Sequence.
</p>

<p>
    Any processes after the Termination step will not be executed.
