<h1>
    Enterprise Service Concepts
</h1>

<p>
    Concepts described in this chapter include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Sequences</li>
    <li>Services</li>
    <li>Configuration</li>
    <li>Logging</li>
</ul>

<h2>
    Sequences
</h2>

<p>
    All work under the Services Package is de-constructed into specific tasks. Each task is implemented as
    an Apex class and is called a Service.
</p>

<p>
    Logically related services are assembled by the System Configurator (or Business Analyst) into
    an ordered arrangement of sequential processing steps collectively called a <em>Sequence</em>
</p>

<h2>
    Services
</h2>

<p>
    Every service responds to an input event and emits  a list of zero, one or more output
    events. The Services Package is designed so that output events from any given service automatically
    feed the input stream of the very next service in a <em>Sequence</em>.
</p>

<p>
    The Services Package has by default a number of ready made services that can be composed sequentially
    so that useful work can be completed. These ready made services include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><em>Debug</em></li>
    <li><em>Jump</em></li>
    <li><em>Transaction</em></li>
    <li><em>Publish</em></li>
    <li><em>Subscribe</em></li>
</ul>

<p>
    Additional services implementing tasks specific to
    your particular business requirements are easily created.

    Detailed instructions for building such services can be found in the
    <a href="?topic=GuideDevelopers">Service Developers Guide</a>
</p>

<h2>
    Configuration
</h2>

<p>
    The Services Package makes a clear distinction between:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <em>what</em> is to be performed (via declarative  assembling of sequential processing
        steps), versus
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>how</em> it is performed (via imperative apex code defining each service - see
        <a href="?topic=GuideDevelopers">Service Developers Guide</a> for further details.)
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Assembling services in a useful sequence and thereby fulfilling the intent of the underlying
    business requirement is the domain of the business analyst and not necessarily the Apex
    developer.

    It therefore the role of the System Orchestrator / Business Analyst to configure the Services Package:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        by arranging services in a ] Sequence using a friendly name that
        adequately describes the collective nature of the work to be preformed (for example
        <code>ProcessInvoices</code>)
    </li>
    <li>
        by identifying tasks that as yet, have no Apex service implementation (otherwise defined
        as "missing services")
    </li>
    <li>
        by specifying and provisioning missing services, often by securing the development
        expertise of a suitable Force.com developer
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>
    Logging
</h2>

<p>
    Salesforce prevents writing to the system log in a Production environment. As a useful
    substitute, the Services Package provides two logging mechanisms:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        a <code>DebugService</code> which acts a no-operation service with  no side effects. The Debug
        service will send an email containing the current event to a nominated user.
    </li>
    <li>
        the <em>Messages</em> tab  detailing the progression of any event from genesis to completion.
        The detailed view on any selected message displays the parent message and a related list of all
        child messages. In addition, the exception trace is attached to the message containing any
        event that fails to
        process correctly.
    </li>
</ul>
