<!--
 ! Trying not to say "Service" unless we refer to "ApexClass"
 ! I like also "Service Definition" ... do we change the label?

<p>
    A service is a single, logical program with inputs and outputs in the form of events.
    Services are implemented as Apex classes.
    Each service handles one event, and may output zero, one, or many new events.
    All the traits available to service authors can be availed using a
    <a href="?topic=ApiServiceDefinition">Service Definition</a>.
</p>

<p>
    This example shows the use of the service definition class, which you will see throughout tutorials and documentation:
</p>

<pre>
global class ExampleService extends Abstract.Service {
    
    global class Definition extends Abstract.Service.Definition {
        String Description = 'Example Service';
    }
    
    override public void callouts(Map&lt;String,Object&gt; event) {
        //perform service callouts
    }
    
    override public List&lt;Map&lt;String,Object&gt;&gt; execute(Map&lt;String,Object&gt; inputEvent) {
        //implement service logic
    }
    
}
</pre>

    All output event parameters must be JSON serializable, to ensure they can be persisted between execution contexts.
    <br /><br />
    The service bus writes state to the database before and after service execution. This allows you to recovery from errors.
