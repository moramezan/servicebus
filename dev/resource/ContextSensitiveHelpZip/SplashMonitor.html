<h1>
    Introducing the Services framework Monitor
</h1>

<p>
    A monitoring page facilitates system activity at a glance.
    The horizontal axis
    shows the route names touched by the framework in some way while
    the vertical axis indicates the  message count for a given combination of status and route.
    <ul>
        <li>
        The <span style="color:#8E66FF;">blue</span> area on the left indicates the presence of system level queueing.
        </li>
        <li>
        The <span style="color:#090;">green</span> areas indicate buffered messages.
        The framework will not attempt process these messages.
        </li>
        <li>
        The <span style="color:#C2C2C2;">grey</span> areas indicate paused messages.
        The framework will not attempt process these messages.
        </li>
        <li>
        The <span style="color:#900;">red</span> areas indicate exception messages.
        The framework will not attempt process these messages.
        </li>
        <li>
        The <span style="color:#DDE578;">yellow</span> areas indicate messages currently being worked on.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

    <img width="800" src="resources/Splashes/monitor.png" />
</p>

<p>
    A spinner at the top of the vertical axis indicates that the Services framework is actively processing messages.
    If the Services framework has yet to execute for the first time the spinner icon is
    rendered as a sparkler. The lack of an icon at the top of the vertical axis indicates
    that the Services framework is not currently running.
