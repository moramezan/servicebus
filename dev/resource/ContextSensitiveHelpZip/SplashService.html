    What is a service?
</h3>

<p>
    A service is a single piece of business logic implemented as an Apex class.
    Every service handles one event and emits a collection containing zero, one or many new events.
    Each service class contains a Service Definition that describes its behavior.
</p>

<h2>
    How to enqueue events to a service?
</h2>

<p>
    <code>
        event = new Map&lt;String,Object&gt;();
        <br />
        event.put('ToService', 'MyServiceName');
        <br />
        Services.Enqueue.invoke(event);
    </code>
</p>

<h3>
    How to author custom services?
</h3>

<pre>
global class MyService extends Abstract.Service {
    
    global class Definition extends Abstract.Service.Definition {
        String Description = 'Short explanation of the service.';
    }
    
    override public void callout(Map&lt;String,Object&gt; event) {
        //perform service callouts
    }
    
    override public List&lt;Map&lt;String,Object&gt;&gt; execute(Map&lt;String,Object&gt; inputEvent) {
        //implement service logic
    }
    
}
</pre>

<!--
<p>
    Services are implemented as Apex classes. The Service Bus contains
    by default a number of ready-made services, including:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Schedule</li>
    <li>Publish and Subscribe</li>
    <li>Branch, Jump and Subsequence</li>
    <li>Audit and Wiretap</li>
    <li>Mark and Gate</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>View Apex Class</strong> will show you the Apex Class that contains the underlying logic
    for any given Service.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>View Settings</strong> takes you to the available Settings for a Service. (Note: Not all
    service have Settings)
</p>

<p>
    <strong>View Documentation</strong> shows the supporting documentation provided by the author of

<h3>
    Discovering Services
</h3>

<p>
    Before a service written in Apex can be referenced as a step in a sequence, it must first be
    discovered and registered in the Enterprise Services framework.
</p>

<p>
    This discovery job will be launched automatically when installing the package or trying to build
    a sequence for the first time.
</p>

<p>
    There is also a mechanism for discovering services manually and is initiated by clicking the
    [Discover] button from the Services list view.
</p>

    Learn more about <a href="?topic=TutorialProcessDiscovery">Service Discovery</a> within the Service Bus.
