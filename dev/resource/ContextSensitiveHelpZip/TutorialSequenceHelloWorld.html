<h1>
    Sequence Hello World Tutorial
</h1>


<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
    This tutorial demonstrates the invocation of business steps in a logical sequence.
    It makes use of the support infrastructure afforded by the Services Package.
    In this demonstration, we will create a simple sequence containing three Wiretap steps.
</p>

<p>
    Expected Duration: 10 minutes.
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        Open the App menu on the top right of Salesforce and choose Services.
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Navigate to the Sequences tab. If you are presented with the splash page, simply click the Continue button
            located towards the bottom right of the page.
        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Note</legend>
            Sequences facilitate the execution of services in the correct order.
            <br />
            The Sequences tab lists these configured groups of sequential processing steps.
        </fieldset>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Click the <em>New Sequence</em> button. Name the sequence
            <code>SendTestEmails</code>, then click Save. This will take you to the drag-and-drop
            Sequence Builder where you can add and delete Steps.
        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Note</legend>
            The Terminate step is automatically added to all sequences. Sequences must
            always end with the Terminate step.
        </fieldset>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Repeat the following three times:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                Click the <em>New Step</em> button and highlight the Services tag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="resources/TutorialSetupConfirmation/group.png" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                From the <em>Services</em> tag choose <em>Wiretap</em>. This will
                create a Wiretap step at the end of the sequence.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        Using drag and drop, reorder the three Wiretap steps so that the Terminate service occupies
        the last position in the Sequence.
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Your <code>SendTestEmails</code> Sequence should now look like this:
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="resources/TutorialSetupConfirmation/sequence.png" />
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    You are now ready to execute the steps in the <code>SendTestEmails</code> sequence.
</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        Click the <em>Enqueue Test Event</em> button located towards the top of the page.
    </li>
    <li>
        A dialogue will appear to indicate an event has been enqueued.
        <p>
            <img src="resources/TutorialSetupConfirmation/test-enqueued-message.png" />
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Check your email inbox which will eventually reflect three emails:
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="resources/TutorialSetupConfirmation/many-emails.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            Each email represents an event entering and exiting a Wiretap step in the sequence.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, every email contains details  applicable to the context of the  <em>Enqueue Test Event</em> button
            press action and step specific aspects such as the sequence position of the <code>Wiretap</code>  service.
            Note that some of the context attributes (such as the recipient of the email) are configurable
            while other attributes  (such as the identity of the user generating the enqueue event)
            are determined by the container and are not available for modification.
