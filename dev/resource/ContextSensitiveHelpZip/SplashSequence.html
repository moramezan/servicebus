    What is a sequence?
</h2>

<p>
    A sequence is an arrangement of processing tasks called steps.
    Events enter the top of the sequence and flow through the steps in order.
    The sequence has a name (eg 'Generate Calls') which indicates the kind of work its steps perform.
</p>

<p>
    Steps are arranged using the drag and drop builder.
    The last step of every sequence is a terminate service.
    This swallows events that reach the end of the sequence.

<h2>
    How to enqueue events to a sequence?
</h2>

<p>
    <code>
        event = new Map&lt;String,Object&gt;();
        <br />
        event.put('ToSequence', 'MySequenceName');
        <br />
        Services.Enqueue.invoke(event);
    </code>
</p>

<h2>
    When to use sequences?
</h2>

<ul>
    <li>To arrange services in order declaratively.</li>
    <li>When business logic consists of multiple services.</li>
    <li>For splitting and then aggregating collections of events.</li>
    <li>When services need to communicate between each other.</li>
</ul>
