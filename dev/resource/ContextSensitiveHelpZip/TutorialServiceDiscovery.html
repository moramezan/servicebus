<h1>
    Service Discovery Tutorial
</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
    This tutorial demonstrates the discovery of new business logic.
    We will create a new service conforming to a standard definition so that it can be
    referenced by the Services Package.
</p>


<p>
    Expected duration: 10 minutes.
</p>

<br/>

<h2>Background Context</h2>
<p>
    Before a Service can be referenced as a step in a sequence, it must first be discovered by the Services Package.
    It detects all Apex Classes in the organization that conform to a service definition.
    All valid services are made available for potential selection by the system orchestrator when building sequences under the tab.
