<h1>
    Branch, Jump and Subsequence services
</h1>

<p>
    Execution logic is often broken into two or more sequences. A need therefore arises to connect
    the business logic contained in these sequences
</p>

<p>
    The <em>Branch</em>, <em>Jump</em> and <em>Subsequence</em> services allow messages to
    transition between sequences.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            The <em>Jump</em> service directs execution flow to the first step in an alternative
            sequence.
        </p>

        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Note</legend>
            Steps in the current sequence following a <em>Jump</em> step will not be executed.
        </fieldset>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The <em>Branch</em> service directs execution flow to the first step in an alternative
            sequence AND allows the remaining steps in the current sequence to complete.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img width="360" src="resources/Processes/Branch.png" />
        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Note</legend>
            Unlike the <em>Jump</em> service, steps in the current sequence following a
            <em>Branch</em> step will still be executed
        </fieldset>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The <em>Subsequence</em> service directs execution flow to the first step in an
            alternative sequence.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img width="480" src="resources/Processes/Subsequence.png" />
        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Note</legend>
            When execution reaches the <em>Terminate</em> step in the alternative sequence,
            execution flow returns to the step immediately following the <code>Subsequence</code>
            step of the current Sequence
        </fieldset>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Config</h2>

<p>
    To specify the sequence to jump to, click <strong>Configure</strong> next to a <em>Jump</em>
    sequence step. Clicking the configure link will redirect to the <em>Jump</em> config view. In
    the Sequence field, enter the name of the sequence to jump to.
</p>

<p>
    To specify the sequence to branch to, click <strong>Configure</strong> link next to a
    <em>Branch</em> sequence step. Clicking the configure link will redirect to the
    <em>Branch</em> config view. In the Sequence field, enter the name of the sequence to
    branch to.
</p>

<p>
    To specify the sequence to execute before returning, click <strong>Configure</strong> clink next to a
    <em>Subsequence</em> sequence step. Clicking the configure link will redirect to the
    <em>Subsequence</em> config view. In the Sequence field, enter the name of the sequence to
    execute.
