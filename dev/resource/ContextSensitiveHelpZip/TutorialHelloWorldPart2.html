    Hello World Tutorial - Part 2
</h1>


<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
    This tutorial demonstrates the invocation of business steps
    in a logical sequence by making use of the support infrastructure afforded by the Service Bus container.
    In this demonstration, we will create a simple sequence containing three Wiretap steps.
</p>

<p>
    Expected Duration: 10 minutes.
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        Open the App menu on the top right of Salesforce and choose Service Bus.
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Navigate to the Sequences tab. If you are presented with the splash page, simply click the Continue button
            located towards the bottom right of the page.
            You may need to wait a few moments while the  housekeeping Service Discovery  task completes.
        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Note</legend>
            Sequences facilitate the execution of services in the correct order
            under the support infrastructure of the Service Bus container.
            The Sequences tab lists these previously configured groups of sequential processing steps.
        </fieldset>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Click the <em>New Sequence</em> button. Name the sequence
            <code>SendTestEmails</code>, then click Save. This will take you to the drag-and-drop
            Sequence Builder where you can add and delete Steps.
        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Note</legend>
            The special Terminate step is automatically added to all sequences. Sequences must
            always end with the Terminate step.
        </fieldset>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Repeat the following three times:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                Click the <em>New Step</em> button and highlight the Service Bus tag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="resources/TutorialSetupConfirmation/group.png" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                From the <em>Service Bus</em> tag choose <em>Wiretap</em>. This will
                create a Wiretap step at the end of the sequence.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Note</legend>
            <!--A Tag is simply a category used to display related Services. see /// TODO - building a service/// for further details.-->
        </fieldset>
    </li>

    <li>
        Using drag and drop, reorder the three Wiretap steps so that the Terminate service occupies
        the last position in the Sequence.
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Your <code>SendTestEmails</code> Sequence should now look like this:
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="resources/TutorialSetupConfirmation/sequence.png" />
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    You are now ready to execute the steps in the <code>SendTestEmails</code> sequence.
</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        Click the <em>Inject Test Event</em> button located towards the top of the page.
    </li>
    <li>
        A dialogue will appear to indicate an event has been enqueued.
        <p>
            <img src="resources/TutorialSetupConfirmation/test-enqueued-message.png" />
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Check your email inbox which will eventually reflect three emails:
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="resources/TutorialSetupConfirmation/many-emails.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            Each email represents an event entering and exiting a Wiretap step in the sequence.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, every email contains details  applicable to the context of the  <em>Enqueue Test Event</em> button
            press action and step specific aspects such as the sequence position of the <code>Wiretap</code>  service.
            Note that some of the context attributes (such as the recipient of the email) are configurable
            while other attributes  (such as the identity of the user generating the enqueue event)
            are solely determined and provided by the framework and are not available for modification.

        </p>
