<h1>
    Terminate Service
</h1>

<p>
    Every Sequence must have a Terminate Service.
</p>

<p>
    A Terminate service step is automatically inserted when a Sequence is created.
</p>

<p>
    It is the orchestrator's responsibility to ensure the termination service is the final step in the Sequence.
</p>

<p>
    Any services after the Termination step will not be executed.
