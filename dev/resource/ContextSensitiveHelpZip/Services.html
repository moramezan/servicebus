<h1>
    Core Processes

<p>
    This section is intended for Service Bus Configurators, Business Analysts, Salesforce System
    Administrators, and Force.com Apex Developers. The purpose is to explain the use and
    configuration of each pre-packaged process in the Service Bus framework.

<p>
    This section does not cover designing building and deploying custom services. That topic is
    described in the separate <a href="?topic=GuideDevelopers">Process Developer's Guide</a>. This
    section does not cover configuring or monitoring the Enterprise Service Bus. That topic is
    described in the separate <a href="?topic=GuideOrchestrators">Orchestrator's Guide</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The Service Bus has pre-packaged services. These pre-packaged processes are classified
    under the tag "Service Bus". Some processes work in isolation (for example
    <em>Wiretap</em>) while other processes work in tandem (for example <em>Publish</em> and
    <em>Subscribe</em>)

    Some processes are no-operation or pass-through in nature. These simply forward all
    received messages to the next step in their respective sequence, without any side effects.
