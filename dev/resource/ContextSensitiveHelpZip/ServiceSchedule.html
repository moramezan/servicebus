<h1>
    Schedule service
</h1>

<p>
    Certain events are time based. Time is a continuous flow but in reality, most systems are
    interested in the occurrence of discreet time events such as 12:00 pm GMT, Monday.
</p>
    
<p>
    The <em>Schedule</em> service has a configurable schedule to register interest in the
    occurrence of discrete future time based events. This register is called a schedule. The
    <em>Schedule</em> service emits a message whenever a registered scheduled event has occurred.
</p>

    Config
</h2>

<p>
    To specify a schedule, click the configure link next to a Schedule sequence step. Clicking the
    configure link will redirect to the Schedule config.
</p>

<p>
    A schedule has one or more hourly time intervals defining when the schedule should fire. The
    schedule can be further filtered by frequency and run dates.
</p>

<p>
    In the Run Times field, select one or more hourly time intervals that specify when the schedule
    should fire. (The framework assumes all times are specified in GMT with no reference to Org or
    user's time zone settings.)
</p>

<p>
    In the Frequency field, select the frequency from Daily, Weekly or Monthly. The value selected
    defines the available values under the Run dates picklist.
