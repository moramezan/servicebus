<h1>
    Publish and Subscribe processes
</h1>

<p>
    The <em>Publish</em> and <em>Subscribe</em> processes work together to bind two or more
    sequences. This binding is achieved by specifying a common Event Type that is shared between
    both the <em>Publish</em> and <em>Subscribe</em> processes.
</p>

</p>

<p>
    The <em>Publish</em> process directs the message to the common event type and the
    <em>Subscribe</em> process retrieves from the common event type. This indirection facilitates
    the retrieval of the same event type by more than one <code>Subscribe</code> process.
</p>

<p>
    A <em>Subscribe</em> process must always be the first process in a Sequence
</p>

<h2>
    Config
</h2>

<p>
    An event type must be specified for both the <em>Subscribe</em> and <em>Publish</em> processes.
    An event type is created from the configuration screen of either the <em>Publish</em> or
    <em>Subscribe</em> processes. To specify the event type:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Click <strong>Configure</strong> next to either a <em>Publish</em> or <em>Subscribe</em>
        step in the sequence builder. This will open the config screen.
    </li>
    <li>
        On the config screen, click <strong>Manage Event Types</strong>
        then click <strong>New Event Type</strong> to create a new event type.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    To publish to an event type, click <strong>Configure</strong> next to a <em>Publish</em>
    step in the sequence builder. Select an event type to publish to by clicking the Event Type
    lookup field.
</p>

<p>
    To subscribe to an event type, click the configure link next to a <em>Subscribe</em> step (if
    not already on the <em>Subscribe</em> configuration view)
</p>

<p>
    Select a named event to subscribe to by clicking the Event Type lookup field.
</p>
