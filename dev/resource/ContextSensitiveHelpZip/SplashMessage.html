    An event is any real world occurrence with business significance, for example a request for payment.
    <br />
    Event parameters are represented by <code>Map&lt;String,Object&gt;</code>

    What is a message?
</h2>

<p>
    A message is a container for recording an event.
    Wrapping each event in a message gives a handle to identify it.
    Because the event parameters are persisted inside the message,
    you can re-attempt unprocessable events after an exception occurs.
</p>

<p>
    If an exception happens, you can modify the service logic or the event data, then take action:
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Restart</dt>
    <dd>
        Synchronously and immediately reprocesses one message.
    </dd>

    <dt>Rebuffer</dt>
    <dd>
        Asynchronously reprocesses multiple messages.
    </dd>

    <dt>Kill</dt>
    <dd>
        Discards multiple messages.
    </dd>
</dl>
