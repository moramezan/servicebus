<h3>
    What is a message?
</h3>

<p>
    <img class="right" src="resources/Splashes/messages.png" />
    A message is a container for holding a real world event. These events occur all the time, for example a clock strikes
    midnight, or a payment is requested. Wrapping each event in a message gives a handle to identify it.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>The event JSON can be seen inside each message.</li>
    <li>If a service ever fails, the message remains visible for retry.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
    How do I deal with failed messages?
</h3>

<p>
    All messages are stored in a queue for review. You can either:
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Restart</dt>
    <dd>
        to reprocess it again synchronously, after fixing the apex code or the event;
        <br />
        this is immediate and highly responsive, used to the benefit of developers.
    </dd>
    
    <dt>Rebuffer</dt>
    <dd>
        to requeue it again asynchronously, after fixing the apex code or the event;
        <br />
        this is asynchronous, and can be performed on large groups of messages.
    </dd>
    
    <dt>Kill</dt>
    <dd>
        to dismiss it, if the failure was expected and acceptable;
        <br />
        this should only be used when the situation is unrecoverable.
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>
    <strong>Pause Queue</strong> halts the processing of new Messages. New Messages will be queued
    up outside their destined Sequence. Old Messages already in a Sequence will filter through to
    completion.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Resume Queue</strong> resumes the processing of all Messages.

<p>
    <strong>Process Message</strong> forces this Message to be processed immediately. You can use
    this button to process individual Messages when the system is paused, or to reprocess any
    Message that could not be processed.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Show Data</strong> takes you to the native view of the underlying data pointed at by the
    Message. This button can be used to edit or audit the data of any specific Message handed into a
    given Process.
