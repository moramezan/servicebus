    An event is any real world occurrence with business significance, for example a request for payment.
    <br />
    Event parameters are represented by <code>Map&lt;String,Object&gt;</code>

    What is a message?
</h2>

<p>
    A message is a container for recording an event.
    Wrapping each event in a message gives a handle to identify it.
    Because the event parameters are persisted inside the message,
    you can re-attempt unprocessable events after an exception occurs.
</p>

<p>
    If an exception happens, modify the service or the event, then take action:
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Restart the message</dt>
    <dd>
        This action is synchronous and responds immediately.
    </dd>

    <dt>Rebuffer messages</dt>
    <dd>
        This action is asynchronously, for larger groups of messages.
    </dd>

    <dt>Kill messages</dt>
    <dd>
        This action asserts that the event should be dismissed.
        <br />
        For example if the failure was expected or recovered manually.
    </dd>
</dl>
