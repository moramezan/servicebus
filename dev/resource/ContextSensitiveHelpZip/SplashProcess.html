<h1>
    Introducing Processes
</h1>

<p>
    A Process is a single, logical program with inputs and outputs in the form of Messages. Logic
    that splits data, combines data or alters data should be encapsulated in distinct processes.
    When a process receives and acts on a message, it may output multiple new messages that go to
    subsequent processes.

<p>
    Processes are implemented as Apex classes. The Enterprise Service Bus framework ("ESB") contains
    by default a number of ready-made processes, including:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Schedule</li>
    <li>Publish and Subscribe</li>
    <li>Branch, Jump and Subsequence</li>
    <li>Audit and Wiretap</li>
    <li>Mark and Gate</li>
</ul>

    <strong>View Apex Class</strong> will show you the Apex Class that contains the underlying logic
    for any given Process.

<h3>
    Discovering Processes
</h3>

<p>
    Before a process written in Apex can be referenced as a step in a sequence, it must first be
    discovered and registered in the Enterprise Service Bus framework.
</p>

<p>
    This discovery job will be launched automatically when installing the package or trying to build
    a sequence for the first time.
</p>

<p>
    There is also a mechanism for discovering processes manually and is initiated by clicking the
    [Discover] button from the Processes list view.
