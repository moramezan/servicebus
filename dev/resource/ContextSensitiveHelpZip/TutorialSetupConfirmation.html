<h1>
    Setup Confirmation Tutorial
</h1>

<p>
    The objective of this tutorial is to confirm that the Service Bus has been correctly
    configured by making use of a simple Sequence containing three Wiretap steps.
</p>

<p>
    Expected Duration: 15 minutes.
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        Open the App menu on the top right of Salesforce and choose Service Bus.
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Navigate to the Sequences tab and click <em>New Sequence</em>. Name the sequence
            <code>SendTestEmails</code>, then click Save. This will take you to the drag-and-drop
            Sequence Builder where you can add and delete Steps.
        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Note</legend>
            The special Terminate step is automatically added to all sequences. Sequences must
            always end with the Terminate step.
        </fieldset>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Repeat the following three times:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Click the <em>New Step</em> button which will open a list of Tags, then Services.
            </li>
            <li>
                From the <em>Enterprise Service Bus</em> tag choose <em>Wiretap</em>. This will
                create a Wiretap step at the end of the sequence.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Note</legend>
            A Tag is just like a category used to display related Services together.
        </fieldset>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        Using drag and drop, reorder the three Wiretap steps so that the Terminate service occupies
        the last position in the Sequence.
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Your <code>SendTestEmails</code> Sequence should now look like this:
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="resources/TutorialSetupConfirmation/Steps.png" />
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    You are now ready to execute the steps in the <code>SendTestEmails</code> sequence.
</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        Click <em>Inject Test Message</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
        A dialogue will appear to indicate a message has been enqueued.
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Check your email. Your inbox will receive one email from each of the three Wiretap steps:
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="resources/TutorialSetupConfirmation/Email.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            Each email represents a message entering and exiting a Wiretap step in the sequence.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
