<h2>
    Visually Test the Service
</h2>

<p>
    A service conforming to the
    <a href="https://github.com/bigassforce/OASIS" target="_blank">OASIS</a>
    specification is automatically detected and registered
    by the Services framework.

</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        If your service requires no injected context or step level configuration,
        simply navigate to the services tab, click on your services link and press the
        Enqueue Test Event button. Then navigate to the Messages tab to review the emitted
        event(s) from your service to confirm your service executed in an expected manner.
    </li>

    <li>
        If your service requires step level configuration,
        simply navigate to the Sequences tab and create a simple sequence to host your service
        From the Sequence builder,
        click the Enqueue Test Event button. Then navigate to the Messages tab to review the emitted
        event(s) from your service to confirm your service executed in an expected manner.
    </li>

    <li>
        If your service requires specific input parameter values,
        create a mock service that emits a single event containing the parameter events
        and values required by your service.
        Next, navigate to the Sequences tab and create a simple sequence to host your service
        and your mock sequence supply the initial input event state for your service. Arrange\
        the services on your test sequence so that the mock service immeadiately precedes
        your service.
        Finally, from the Sequence builder,
        click the Enqueue Test Event button. Then navigate to the Messages tab to review the emitted
        event(s) from your service to confirm your service executed in an expected manner.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>
    Creating a managed package containing your service
</h2>

<p>
    You can host your services in a
    <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/packagingGuide/index_Left.htm#StartTopic=Content/packaging_testing.htm" target="_blank">
        managed package
    </a>  by following standard Salesforce recommendations.
    Add your service class to the package along with unit tests and associated dependencies and then upload.
    This compiled service logic can now be installed in any Developer, Sandbox or Production org
    using the the package link.
