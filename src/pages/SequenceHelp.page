                <p>A Sequence is an arrangement of multiple processing tasks called Steps.</p>
                <p>Each Sequence is known by a friendly name, for example 'ProcessInvoices', which should describe the nature of the work performed by its processing tasks or Steps.</p>
                <p>The EDA framework will advance Messages through the Steps of a Sequence in the order you arrange. A typical sequence will contain many steps. See below:</p>
