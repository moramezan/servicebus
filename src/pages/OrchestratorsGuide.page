                    <li>Arrange processing steps into a logical processing sequence
                    </li>
                    <li>Combine two or more processing sequences by using PubSub or Branching techniques.

                    <li>Events occur all the time. (For example: the clock strikes twelve, the fuel tank reaches empty)
                    </li>
                    <li>To represent details about an event in a computer system, we use a special object called a <code>message</code>
                    </li> 
                    <li>The primary purpose of a message is to provide a useful mechanism to communicate between processes that a particular event has occurred.

                <b>Event Based Architecture :</b><br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>Specific events are only relevant to specific processes - for this reason a <code>system broker</code> routes specific event messages to specific processes within the system.
                    </li> 
                    <li>Combinations of specific event messages to specific Processes can be reduced to a table called a <code>routing table</code>. The routing table is used by the <code>broker</code>.
                    </li> 
                    <li>Breaking up work into specific processes that respond to specific event messages is called Event Driven Architecture. ("EDA")

                <ul>
                    <li>Most implementations on Salesforce make use of an alternative to EDA call "command-response architecture".
                    </li> 
                    <li>Under this model, work is centrally directed from a command such as a [button click] or a  [trigger action].
                    </li> 
                    <li>Complexity quickly grows in an exponential manner as possible execution paths and exception handling paths are added to the logic directly attached to the command.

                    </li> 
                    <li>A message received by a  process that has previously registered it's interest in that Event causes it's underlying Apex logic to execute

                <ul>
                    <li>As previously mentioned, Event Driven Architecture allows useful work to take place on the Salesforce platform by processes that have previously registered their interest the occurrence of a specific Event.
                    </li> 
                    <li>In practise this means that a process registers it's interest in events emitted from the process that immediately precedes it.
                    </li> 
                    <li>A register of interest containing sufficient number of processes will naturally resemble a <code>Sequence</code> of processing steps
                    </li> 
                    <li>This register is called a <code>Sequence</code> and the sequential processing steps within it are called <code>Sequence Steps</code>

                <b>Summary :</b><br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>Event Driven Architecture provides a framework that logically maps  processing steps to an underlying business requirement.
                        <br/>Emphasis is placed on  narrowly defined , composable units of work , each of which responding to a specific event that has occurred. 
                        <br/>It provides a clean model that limits complexity in the system to just the testable apex implementation details of any given process.
                    </li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>In contrast to EDA, the command-response paradigm attempts to attach all possible logical code paths and associated exception handling to a single specific command. 
                        <br/>This creates code complexity that is not easily tested or modified.

                <ul> 
                    <li>Work in  Event Driven Architecture is broken up into many specific tasks
                    </li>
                    <li>Each task is implemented as an Apex class and is called an Event Driven Process.
                    </li>
                    <li>Logically related processes are assembled by the System Configurator / Business Analyst into sequential processing steps called a <code>Processing Sequence</code>
                    </li>

                <b>Event Driven Process  :</b><br/>
                <ul> 
                    <li>Every Event Driven Process responds to an input event message by emitting a list of zero or more output  messages
                    </li>
                    <li>The EDA framework is designed so that output  messages from a process automatically feed the input stream of the very next process in a <code>Processing Sequence</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>The EDA framework has by default a number of ready made processes that can be sequenced together so that useful work can be completed.
                    </li>
                    <li>These ready made processes include: 
                             <code>Wiretap</code> ,
                             <code>Jump</code>  ,
                             <code>Branch</code> ,
                             <code>SubSequence</code> ,
                             <code>Publish</code> and
                             <code>Subscribe</code>
                    </li>         
                    <li>Additional processes can be easily created to implement tasks specific to your particular requirement(s).

                <ul> 
                    <li>Routing is the term used to denote the marshalling event messages between  event driven  processes.
                    </li>
                    <li>As previously mentioned, the assembling or linking of processes in a specific order via point and click creates a sequence of <code>Processing Steps</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Each <code>Processing Step</code> in the Sequence has a definitive position associated with it.
                    </li>
                    <li>The first step in the Sequence has a position of "1", the second has a position of "2" and so forth
                    </li>
                    <li>Using the ordered position of each step, the framework is able to route an event messages along it's   <code>Processing Sequence </code>

                        <ol>
                            <li>  by linking event driven  processes together in a Processing Sequences using  friendly names that adequately describe the collective nature of the work being preformed (for example "ProcessInvoices" )
                            </li>
                            <li>  by identifying tasks in a Sequence that have no corresponding Event Driven Architecture process ("missing processes")
                            </li>
                            <li>  to specify and provision missing event driven  processes by securing the services of a suitable Force.com developer where necessary
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>

                <b>Logging :</b><br/>
                    <br/>Salesforce prevents writing to the system log in a Production environment.
                    <br/>As a useful substitute, the EDA framework  provides two out-of-the box logging mechanisms :  
                <ul> 
                    <li><b>WireTap </b>
                        <br/>A <code>Wiretap</code> process acts a no-operation pass through process and has no side effects. 
                        <br/>A <code>Wiretap</code> process   will however send an email containing the current event message to a nominated user. 
                    </li>
                    
                    <br/>
                    
                    <li> <b>LogWriter</b>
                        <br/>A <code>LogWriter</code> process  acts a no-operation pass through process and has no side effects. 
                        <br/>A <code>LogWriter</code> will however store the event message under a useful business identifier. 
                        <br/>Many  <code>LogWriter</code> processes placed at strategic steps in a <code>Sequence</code> can usefully track and relate the progress of event messages using a common business identifier.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <b>External Boundary - Inbound :</b><br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>An external event (for example "Time is 12:01" , "Stock price changed" ) is not directly consumable by the event driven framework.
                    </li>
                    <li>Instead, EDA framework configurators make use of the enqueue() method to transform  an external event  into an event message which is injected into the EDA framework.
                    </li>
                    <li>The EDA framework supports two variations of the enqueue() method, namely 
                        <ol>
                            <li>  Enqueue(String SequenceName, Id id ) and 
                            </li>
                            <li>  Enqueue(String SequenceName, Blob data )
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <br/><b>Usage:</b>
                        <br/>The  "SequenceName" parameter defines which Processing Sequence configured  in the EDA framework will react to the injected event message
                        <br/>Use the Enqueue(String SequenceName, Id id ) method whenever the data related to the external event is retrievable as an Salesforce object by passing in that object's Id.
                        <br/>Use the Enqueue(String SequenceName, Blob data ) method whenever the data related to the external event is a blob of data not yet persisted in Salesforce by passing in the Blob.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br/><br/>

                <b>External Boundary - Outbound :</b><br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>Any process is free to communicate outside the framework boundary via an http callout, the invocation of a workflow rule DML operations and / or the sending of one or more email messages.
                    </li>

                <b>Internal Boundary :</b><br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>All Sequences have a <code>Terminator</code> process as their last processing step. (Conceptually this is very similar to a "buffer stop" at the end of a railway line)
                    </li>
                    <li>A <code>Terminator</code> processing step is automatically inserted when the Processing Sequence is created.
                    </li>
                    <li>Sequences may interact with one another via one of four standard pre-packaged processes, namely 
                        <code>Jump</code>, 
                        <code>Branch</code>, 
                        <code>Subroutine</code> 
                        or 
                        <code>Publish/Subscribe</code>
